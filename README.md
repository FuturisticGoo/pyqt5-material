## PyQt5 Material

This is another stylesheet for PyQt5 which looks like Material Design
This is forked from the amazing stylesheet made by UN-GCPDS, here : https://github.com/UN-GCPDS/pyside-material


Some custom dark themes:

## Install
```bash
  pip install pyqt5-material
```

## Usage

```python
import sys
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets
from pyqt5_material import apply_stylesheet

# create the application and the main window
app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
window = QtWidgets.QMainWindow()

# setup stylesheet
apply_stylesheet(app, theme='dark_teal.xml')

# run
window.show()
app.exec_()
```

## Themes

```
from pyqt5_material import list_themes

list_themes()
```

```
light_yellow.xml
light_teal.xml
dark_purple.xml
light_amber.xml
light_blue.xml
light_purple.xml
dark_pink.xml
light_cyan.xml
dark_blue.xml
dark_teal.xml
dark_lightgreen.xml
light_lightgreen.xml

# Custom colors

[Color Tool](https://material.io/resources/color/) is the best way to
generate new themes, just choose colors and export as `Android XML`, the theme
file must look like:

```xml
<!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?-->
<resources>
  <color name="primaryColor">#1de9b6</color>
  <color name="primaryLightColor">#6effe8</color>
  <color name="primaryDarkColor">#00b686</color>
  <color name="secondaryColor">#263238</color>
  <color name="secondaryLightColor">#4f5b62</color>
  <color name="secondaryDarkColor">#000a12</color>
  <color name="primaryTextColor">#000000</color>
  <color name="secondaryTextColor">#ffffff</color>
</resources>
```

Save it as `my_theme.xml` or similar and apply the style sheet from Python.

```python
apply_stylesheet(app, theme='dark_teal.xml')
```


# Light themes


Light will need to add `light_secondary` argument as `True`.

```python
apply_stylesheet(app, theme='dark_teal.xml', light_secondary=True)
```
# Issues

There seems to be an issue when packaging the python file using pyinstaller, it doesn't automatically add the resources folder to the data. A quick fix for this is to first make the spec file

```bash
pyi-makespec --windowed <python source>
```

Here I am using `--windowed` for hiding the console when executing, you can change that
Next, open the .spec file and add `import pyqt5_material,os` at the top, then inside the Analysis datas list, paste this `(os.path.dirname(pyqt5_material.__file__),"pyqt5_material")`

```python
datas=[(os.path.dirname(pyqt5_material.__file__),"pyqt5_material")]  #If it's Windows
```
Save it and now run
```bash 
pyinstaller <spec file>
```
It should work now.
